    FUNCTION: The function can draw line by clicking twice of mouse.
    First click a circle will be created, second click a line will be created link to first clicking position and the

    PRINCIPLE: A parameter is set to differentiate if the clicking number is odd or even. By doing so, if statement is
    utilised to take drawing circle, line and removing action. Bunch of parameter should made global.
